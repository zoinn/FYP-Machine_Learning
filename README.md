# Using Machine Learning To Find Patterns In The Forex Market
I utilized Python and a Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM to predict forex market movements
# How it works
Trained against from previous years of the forex market to be able to predict movments in the market. In this case I predict directionality and through this we got an accuracy of 84%
# What I Learned and Improved on
- How to program a recurrent neural network with LSTM in Pytorch
- Machine Learning with research to find best ML for my case (RNN with LSTM)
- Use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Hyper-Parameter tuning
- Using GET requests to gather data on the forex market and new events
- Applied back testing to data from 2021 to 2024. Getting over 82% percent on each year
- Developed a model with an accuracy of 84%
